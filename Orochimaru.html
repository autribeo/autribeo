                        <p>	This is Orochimaru’s ultimate technique for achieving immortality. Every few years, he transfers his soul into a new host body, allowing him to cheat death indefinitely. Inside this realm, he can overpower the target’s consciousness and take full control of their body. The technique also grants him access to the abilities of his previous hosts.</p>

                        <p>A forbidden technique that allows Orochimaru to summon and control the dead. By sacrificing a living person, he can revive deceased shinobi with near-limitless chakra and regeneration. Although the technique was later perfected by Kabuto, Orochimaru was its original master.

                        <p>Orochimaru created the Cursed Seals, which grant his chosen subjects increased power at the cost of their free will. The most famous example is Sasuke’s Cursed Seal of Heaven, which dramatically boosts his chakra and strength.
